# DeployGate SDK for Android

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/DeployGate/deploygate-android-sdk.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/DeployGate/deploygate-android-sdk)
[ ![Download](https://api.bintray.com/packages/deploygate/maven/sdk/images/download.svg) ](https://bintray.com/deploygate/maven/sdk/_latestVersion)

You can integrate DeployGate's realtime remote logging & crash reporting without code modification on your apps in development.

> 4.3.0 and later require Android Studio whose versions are the latest patch version of 3.3 or above.
> For the more details, please see https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/gradle-plugin#4.0.1

## Install

In your build.gradle of `app` module:

```gradle
repositories {
    jcenter()
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.deploygate:sdk:<latest version>'
}
```

Then synchronize, build and upload your app to DeployGate. [Gradle DeployGate Plugin](https://github.com/DeployGate/gradle-deploygate-plugin/) will be your help.

> Since 4.0.0, you don't need to add `DeployGate.install(this)` to your `Application#onCreate` except you have multiple processes. It is automatically called when your application process starts through the ContentProvider initialization.

### For Jetpack App Startup users or those who would like to initialize SDK manually

DeployGate SDK uses `ContentProvider` to initialize itself so you need to remove the provider from your manifest file.

```AndroidManifest.xml
<application>
    <provider
        android:name="com.deploygate.sdk.DeployGateProvider"
        tools:node="remove"
        />
</application>
```

## Usage

You can retrieve detailed information on current running build and status change events through functions and callback listeners.

For example, you can prevent your application running on unauthorized devices by putting the following code in your main Activity's `Activity#onCreate`.

```java
DeployGate.registerCallback(new DeployGateCallback() {
    @Override
    public void onInitialized(boolean isServiceAvailable) {
        if (!isServiceAvailable) {
            Toast.makeText(this, "DeployGate is not available", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            finish();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onStatusChanged(boolean isManaged, boolean isAuthorized, String loginUsername, boolean isStopped) {
        if (!isAuthorized) {
            Toast.makeText(this, "This device is not authorized to use this app", Toast.LENGTH_SHORT).show();
            finish();
        }
    }

    @Override
    public void onUpdateAvailable(int revision, String versionName, int versionCode) {}
}, true);
```


See [SDK Sample](./sample) for more examples.

## Mock

You may want to remove DeployGate SDK and related code in production build
to reduce your app's footprint.

For your convenience, we provide "Mock" SDK that replaces every function call
to empty implementation so you don't have to modify your code to switch the builds.

To use it, simply replace the dependency from `sdk` to `sdk-mock`.
You can use it with a conjunction of `productFlavors` and `buildConfig` of Gradle
like the following example:

```gradle
dependencies {
    // use full implementation for debug builds
    debugImplementation 'com.deploygate:sdk:<latest version>'

    // use mocked implementation for release builds
    releaseImplementation 'com.deploygate:sdk-mock:<latest version>'
}
```
